                                    * Mediator Design Pattern *                              
 * The Mediator design pattern is a behavioral pattern that promotes loose coupling between objects by centralizing the way they communicate.
 * It defines an object (the mediator) that encapsulates communication logic between multiple objects (colleagues).
 * Instead of direct communication between colleagues, they interact with the mediator, which then relays messages to the appropriate recipients.
 * This promotes a more organized and maintainable system, as changes to communication behavior are localized to the mediator,
 * rather than being scattered across multiple classes.

 * This code implements the Mediator design pattern in C++.
 * The Mediator interface defines a method for sending messages to other objects.
 * The ConcreteColleague classes implement the Device interface, which provides methods for sending and receiving messages.
 * The ConcreteMediator class implements the Mediator interface and uses a list to store all of the devices that are registered with it.
 * The sendMessage() method of the ConcreteMediator class iterates through the list of devices and calls the receive() method on each device. 
 * The main() function of the code creates a HomeAutomationMediator object, a Light object, and a Thermostat object.
 * The Light and Thermostat objects are then registered with the HomeAutomationMediator object.
 * The main() function then calls the send() method on the Light and Thermostat objects,
 * which causes the HomeAutomationMediator object to send messages to all of the registered devices.
